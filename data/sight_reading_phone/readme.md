# Sight reading recordings

Audio recordings of me playing my digital piano, recorded with my phone, hence the awful audio quality!

LH = left hand, RH = right hand, together = hands together.

The three numbered recordings are correct and intended to capture variation.

The others contain deliberate mistakes of various kinds to test any analysis algorithm.

There is also a photo of the exercise (sheet music).

## todo

* Create a MIDI file representing the exercise.
* Develop a function which accepts the correct recordings and rejects the erroneous ones.
